For this task, I needed to implement and test
one version of Dijkstra's algorithm for computing
the shortest path for all vertices in a directed graph,
starting from a chosen source vertex s,
with non-negative weights on all edges.

Also, I implemented and tesed a topologixal sort algorithm by using a queue to compute
and print out a list of topologically sorted nodes from an instance.
